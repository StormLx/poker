Refresh.                                              | Light theme persists due to manual selection in local storage.                                                                                   |     |       |

Instructions are accurate.                                                                             |     |       |
| Env Variables     | App uses environment variables correctly (PORT, REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL). | 1. Modify PORT for server in docker-compose/local. <br> 2. Modify REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL for client build. <br> 3. Run and test. | Server runs on specified port. Client connects to specified URL.                                                                                 |     |       |
